# TimesTx Coding Assessment

This is a basic example project created to test and demonstrate your React (and Next.js) skills.

It's intentionally simple, but fully functional!

To get it running, install the dependencies (`npm install`) and run (`npm run dev`)!

> If you have any issues getting the project up and running, please let us know. We don't want you to get stuck on this.

## 🛠️ Your Task: Improve the Project
Your goal is to spend some focused time (ideally at least 2 hour, but no more than 3 hours) enhancing this project. The main focus is on demonstrating your skills—how much you can get done within that time frame—while also showcasing a bit of creativity. Feel free to add any features or improvements you think would make the project better!

Here are a few ideas to help spark inspiration:

1. Add a navbar, header, and/or footer to the layout
2. Apply styling to improve the look and feel (use a CSS framework or write your own styles)
3. Expand the profile list with more columns (e.g. profile picture, location, phone number, etc.)
3. Add a search bar or filtering options (you may need to explore the API: randomuser.me)
4. Create a full-profile page to display detailed user info
5. There’s a lot of room for creativity here—have fun, and happy coding! 🚀

## ❓ FAQ
1. Can I deviate from the boilerplate code?

Absolutely! Feel free to use whatever approach you believe results in the cleanest and most efficient code—whether that’s inline vs. separated CSS, functional vs. class components, etc.


The most important thing is that your final codebase is self-consistent and easy to follow.
